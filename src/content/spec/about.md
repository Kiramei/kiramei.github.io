# ✨ Nice to meet you — I'm Kiramei! ✨

I used to work as a **full-stack developer**, but recently I shifted my entire focus toward **AI research** — and honestly, it feels like the universe I was always meant to exist in. 🧠🔥  
My current interests revolve around:

- Deep Learning
- Diffusion Models
- Computer Vision
- Generative AI / Creative Systems

Anything that blends **creativity + intelligence** immediately captures my curiosity. 📸🤖  
Research isn’t just work for me — it feels like a puzzle I *want* to solve.

## 🌸 A Little More About Me

Well… here’s the not-so-secret part:  
I’m also (very unapologetically) a **hardcore anime and 2D enthusiast**. (๑>◡<๑)💖

Technology and passion — whether that’s code, models, or fiction — both deserve to be lived **fully**.

## 🎓 Background

- 🏫 Former 2023 President of **SZUEA — Shenzhen University Electronics Association**  
  (Built a tech community, hosted workshops, and supported student research.)

- ⛩ Once studied abroad at **Chiba University, Japan**, which deeply shaped my mindset, aesthetics, and worldview.  
  Japan still feels like another version of home.
